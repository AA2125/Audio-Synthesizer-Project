# Audio-Synthesizer-Project
The Arduino microcontroller was used to generate different waveforms and control buttons corresponding to those waveforms as part of the project. These signals were connected to an electrical board that amplifies, filters and projects the sound through a speaker. An OLED screen was added to display the current waveform being played, allowing the user to keep track while mixing the waveforms. Additionally, an ultrasonic sensor was incorporated to control the intensity of the sound. A balance was maintained between the software and hardware components throughout the project.
